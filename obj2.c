/**
	Simulate booting the operating system by loading the boot program into
	kernel memory.

	This function is called from simulator.c (the simulator driver)
	before processing the event list. Boot() reads in the file boot.dat to load
	the kernel and initialize Mem_Map for the first program execution. Note that
	boot.dat is already open when Boot() is called and can immediately be read
	using the file pointer Prog_Files[BOOT] (Prog_Files is an array of file
	pointers opened by the simulator).

	The upper half of Mem_Map always holds the address map for the operating
	system, i.e., Mem_Map[Max_Segments ... 2*Max_Segments - 1] (the lower half
	is reserved for user programs). The PROGRAM and SEGMENT statements in the
	boot file are used to initialize the appropriate entries in Mem_Map. The
	actual kernel script is loaded into Mem (array representing physical
	memory) starting at absolute memory location 0. The Free_Mem list
	and Total_Free must be updated as the program is loaded to account for
	the region of Mem that is occupied by the kernel. 

	The format of boot.dat is the same as the other "program.dat"
	files, so it is divided into two sections: segment table information and
	instructions. To load the OS program, Boot() calls the Get_Instr() routine
	to read and process each line in the data file. Once the line is read, it is
	then stored in Mem at the appropriate absolute memory address. Once
	the entire OS program is loaded, Boot() should call Display_pgm() to echo 
	the contents of Mem to the output file. 

	<b> Important Notes:</b>
	\li Boot() is only active during objective 2, so if the current objective is not 2, then simply return from the function.
	\li The boot file, boot.dat, is already open when Boot() is called and can immediately be read using the file pointer Prog_Files[BOOT] (Prog_Files is an array of file pointers opened by the simulator).
	\li Get_Instr() is used by the function Loader() in objective 3.

	<b> Algorithm: </b>
	\verbatim
	Read fields the "PROGRAM" and number of segments from boot file

	Read segment information from boot file:
		For each segment in boot file
			Read "SEGMENT size_of_segment access_bits" from boot file
			Set size of current segment
			Set access bits of current segment
			Go to next segment in Mem_Map

	Read instructions from boot file:
		Current position in main memory--incremented for each instruction read

		For each segment
			Set base pointer of segment to its location in main memory
			For each instruction in the segment
				Read instruction into memory--call Get_Instr()
				Increment current position in main memory
			Go to next segment in Mem_Map

		Adjust size of memory since boot program is loaded into memory:
			Decrement total amount of free memory (Total_Free)
			Decrement size of free memory block (Free_Mem->size)
			Move location of first free memory block (Free_Mem->base)

/**
	Read the next instruction from the file Prog_Files[prog_id] into
	instruction.  

	The format of the file is a series of statements of the form
	'opcode operand'. opcode may be an actual instruction, such as SIO, or a
	device, such as DISK. The operand will vary depending on the type of opcode
	read. Each instruction starts on a new line, but consecutive instructions
	may be separated by empty lines. 

	<b> Important Notes:</b>
	\li The operand field of an instr_type structure is defined as a C union, so
	it may represent one of many values but only one at a time. For example,
	instruction->operand.burst is set for an SIO instruction, but
	instruction->operand.count is set for a SKIP instruction.
	\li For device instruction, assign unique opcodes to each device by adding
	NUM_OPCODES to its corresponding dev_id so device codes do not conflict with
	regular op_codes
	\li Get_Instr() is used by Boot() in objective 2 and Loader() in objective
	3.

/**
	Simulate the Central Processing Unit.

	The CPU, in general, does the following:
	\li Fetches the instruction from memory (Mem)
	\li Interprets the instruction.
	\li Creates a future event based on the type of instruction and
	inserts the event into the event queue.

	Set_MAR() is called to define the next memory location for a Fetch().
	The first fetch from memory is based on CPU.state.pc. Instructions that
	create events are:
	\li WIO   							
	\li SIO							
	\li END							
	The SKIP and JUMP instructions are executed in "real-time" until
	one of the other instructions causes a new event.

	An addressing fault could be generated by a call to Fetch() or Write(), so
	Cpu() should just return in this case (the simulator will later call
	Abend_Service() from the interrupt handler routine to end the simulated
	program).

	<b> Important Notes:</b>
	\li Use a special agent ID, i.e., 0, to identify the boot program. For
	all other objectives, the agent ID should be retrieved from the CPU's
	currently running process--use this process's terminal position and add 1
	so that it does not conflict with boot.
	\li The only instructions processed by Cpu() are SIO, WIO, END, SKIP, and
	JUMP. No other instructions, such as REQ and device instructions, are
	encountered in Cpu(). This is by incrementing the program counter by 2 to
	bypass these unused instructions.
	\li A while(1) loop is needed to correctly evaluate SKIP and JUMP
	instructions since multiple SKIP and JUMP instructions may be encountered
	in a row. The loop is exited when an SIO, WIO, or END instruction is
	encountered.
	\li The function Burst_time() should be used to convert CPU cycles for SIO,
	WIO, and END instructions to simulation time (time_type).

	<b> Algorithm: </b>
	\verbatim
	Identify the agent ID for the currently running program:
		If CPU has no active PCB, then the program is boot
		Otherwise, the program is the active process running in the CPU, so use its ID

	Loop forever doing the following:
		Set MAR to CPU's program counter
		Fetch instruction at this address
		If fetch returns a negative value, a fault has occurred, so
			Return

		Determine type of instruction to execute
			If SIO, WIO, or END instruction
				If the objective is 3 or higher
					Increment total number of burst cycles for PCB
				Calculate when I/O event will occur using current time + burst time
				Add event to event list
				Increment PC by 2 to skip the next instruction--device instruction
				Return from Cpu() (exit from loop)

			If SKIP instruction
				If count > 0,
					Decrement count by 1
					Write this change to memory by calling Write()
					If write returns a negative value, a fault has occurred, so
						Return
					Increment the CPU's PC by 2 since the next instruction is to be skipped
				Otherwise, instruction count equals 0, so
					Increment the CPU's PC by 1 since the next instruction, JUMP, is to be executed

	DEBUG_MEM= ON
